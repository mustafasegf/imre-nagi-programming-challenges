Hello this is the first challenge. Is there any prize if you complete this? No. Think about using this as opportunity to learn about low level programming. I'll try to add problem extensions or even new challenges in the future.

Create a simple HTTP server which can process HTTP Get request and return arbitrary response. 

Requirements:
This simple server is expected to receive 1 type of HTTP GET request only. No router is necessary to route request to correct handler (yet)
You may return any arbitrary response back to the client as long as it complies with HTTP.
Use of existing framework or high level libraries are not allowed. You must only use socket API for any languages of your choice to send and receive data to and from the network.
You may use this challenge as part of your software design learning. If you are tasked to create this capabilities, how should you design the interface?

Hint: you might need to have a method to parse request from the network. think about what needs to be done in order to get a complete HTTP request from the connection opened to the server.

Blog with python sample. (I recommend to read the blog, but do not take a look to his solution before creating your own) https://medium.com/@aunnnn/build-a-simple-http-server-from-the-socket-api-9d9df54235f2

When you are done, commit and push to github repository and share the repository URL here. I think we can review/comment each others works.
